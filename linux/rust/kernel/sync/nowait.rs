/// A lock that only offers a [`try_lock`](NoWaitLock::try_lock) method.
///
/// That is, on contention it doesn't offer a way for the caller to block waiting for the current
/// owner to release the lock. This is useful for best-effort kind of scenarios where waiting is
/// never needed: in such cases, users don't need a full-featured mutex or spinlock.
///
/// When the lock is released via call to [`NoWaitLockGuard::unlock`], it indicates to the caller
/// whether there was contention (i.e., if another thread tried and failed to acquire this lock).
/// If the return value is `false`, there was definitely no contention but if it is `true`, it's
/// possible that the contention was when attempting to acquire the lock.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use kernel::sync::NoWaitLock;
///
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// struct Example {
///     a: u32,
///     b: u32,
/// }
///
/// let x = NoWaitLock::new(Example { a: 10, b: 20 });
///
/// // Modifying the protected value.
/// {
///     let mut guard = x.try_lock().unwrap();
///     assert_eq!(guard.a, 10);
///     assert_eq!(guard.b, 20);
///     guard.a += 20;
///     guard.b += 20;
///     assert_eq!(guard.a, 30);
///     assert_eq!(guard.b, 40);
/// }
///
/// // Reading the protected value.
/// {
///     let guard = x.try_lock().unwrap();
///     assert_eq!(guard.a, 30);
///     assert_eq!(guard.b, 40);
/// }
///
/// // Second acquire fails, but succeeds after the guard is dropped.
/// {
///     let guard = x.try_lock().unwrap();
///     assert!(x.try_lock().is_none());
///
///     drop(guard);
///     assert!(x.try_lock().is_some());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The following examples use the [`NoWaitLockGuard::unlock`] to release the lock and check for
/// contention.
