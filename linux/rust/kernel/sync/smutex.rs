//! A simple mutex implementation.
//!
//! Differently from [`super::Mutex`], this implementation does not require pinning, so the
//! ergonomics are much improved, though the implementation is not as feature-rich as the C-based
//! one. The main advantage is that it doesn't impose unsafe blocks on callers.
//!
//! The mutex is made up of 2 words in addition to the data it protects. The first one is accessed
//! concurrently by threads trying to acquire and release the mutex, it contains a "stack" of
//! waiters and a "locked" bit; the second one is only accessible by the thread holding the mutex,
//! it contains a queue of waiters. Waiters are moved from the stack to the queue when the mutex is
//! next unlocked while the stack is non-empty and the queue is empty. A single waiter is popped
//! from the wait queue when the owner of the mutex unlocks it.
//!
//! The initial state of the mutex is `<locked=0, stack=[], queue=[]>`, meaning that it isn't
//! locked and both the waiter stack and queue are empty.
//!
//! A lock operation transitions the mutex to state `<locked=1, stack=[], queue=[]>`.
//!
//! An unlock operation transitions the mutex back to the initial state, however, an attempt to
//! lock the mutex while it's already locked results in a waiter being created (on the stack) and
//! pushed onto the stack, so the state is `<locked=1, stack=[W1], queue=[]>`.
//!
//! Another thread trying to lock the mutex results in another waiter being pushed onto the stack,
//! so the state becomes `<locked=1, stack=[W2, W1], queue=[]>`.
//!
//! In such states (queue is empty but stack is non-empty), the unlock operation is performed in
//! three steps:
//! 1. The stack is popped (but the mutex remains locked), so the state is:
//!    `<locked=1, stack=[], queue=[]>`
//! 2. The stack is turned into a queue by reversing it, so the state is:
//!    `<locked=1, stack=[], queue=[W1, W2]>
//! 3. Finally, the lock is released, and the first waiter is awakened, so the state is:
//!    `<locked=0, stack=[], queue=[W2]>`
//!
//! The mutex remains accessible to any threads attempting to lock it in any of the intermediate
//! states above. For example, while it is locked, other threads may add waiters to the stack
//! (which is ok because we want to release the ones on the queue first); another example is that
//! another thread may acquire the mutex before waiter W1 in the example above, this makes the
//! mutex unfair but this is desirable because the thread is running already and may in fact
//! release the lock before W1 manages to get scheduled -- it also mitigates the lock convoy
//! problem when the releasing thread wants to immediately acquire the lock again: it will be
//! allowed to do so (as long as W1 doesn't get to it first).
//!
//! When the waiter queue is non-empty, unlocking the mutex always results in the first waiter being
//! popped form the queue and awakened.
