Filebench was originally developed within SUN Microsystems by several people:

Richard McDougall
Neelakanth Nadgir
Shawn Debnath
Spencer Shepler
Andrew Wilson
Dominic Kay
Jim Mauro
Matthias Schmidt
Shawn Debnath
Eric Kustarz
Ben Rockwood

After the development has been ceased within SUN, File system and Storage Lab
(FSL) at Stony Brook University got the permission to maintain and develop the
benchmark further.

Vasily Tarasov (vass@fsl.cs.sunysb.edu) at FSL is the person responsible
for Filebench development and support.

Many other people contributed code and thoughts:
